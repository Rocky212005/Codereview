Okay, I've reviewed your JavaScript code snippet:

```javascript
function sum(){ return a+b;}
```

Here's my feedback:

**Issues and Improvements:**

1.  **Missing Parameters:** The `sum` function is intended to add two numbers, but it doesn't accept any arguments (parameters).  It relies on `a` and `b` being defined in some outer scope.  This is generally bad practice because:

    *   **Readability:** It's not immediately clear where `a` and `b` are coming from.
    *   **Maintainability:** If you refactor or move the `sum` function, it might break if `a` and `b` are no longer available in the outer scope.
    *   **Testability:**  It's difficult to reliably test the `sum` function in isolation without setting up the outer scope variables.

2.  **Undeclared Variables (Potential Error):** If `a` and `b` are *not* defined in an outer scope, you'll get a `ReferenceError` when the `sum` function is called.  JavaScript will try to look up these variables and fail if they don't exist.

**Recommended Solution:**

Pass the numbers you want to add as arguments to the function:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Example Usage:
let result = sum(5, 3);  // result will be 8
console.log(result);
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

*   **`function sum(a, b)`:**  The function now explicitly declares that it expects two parameters, `a` and `b`. These are local variables within the function's scope.
*   **`return a + b;`:**  The function now adds the *parameters* `a` and `b`, which are guaranteed to be available when the function is called.

**Further Considerations:**

*   **Error Handling (Optional):**  You might want to add error handling to check if the inputs are actually numbers.  For example:

    ```javascript
    function sum(a, b) {
      if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
        return "Error: Both inputs must be numbers."; // Or throw an Error
      }
      return a + b;
    }
    ```

*   **Naming:** While `sum` is a good name, consider more descriptive names if the function has a more specific purpose (e.g., `calculateTotalCost`, `addDiscount`).

**In summary, always pass arguments to functions instead of relying on global scope, this makes code readable, maintainable and testable.**
